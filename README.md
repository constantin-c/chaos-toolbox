# chaos-toolbox
A simple HTML list with **all basic elements** you need for a website. Ready to get CSSed in a *homogenic* &amp; *reusable* way, and allow for visual verifications on one page.

No dependencies, with the only exception of our beloved normalize.css and some really basic css creepy behavior prevention.
Note : Didn't git ignore normalize.css so you can use this HTML boilerplate without the mandatory need of any command line ; and still be able to update it easily.

## (Only) Command

This is optionnal.
Needs npm to update, not to use.

Update normalize.css
> npm up
