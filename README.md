# chaos-toolbox
A simple HTML list with **all basic element tags** you need for a website. Ready to get CSSed in a *homogenic* &amp; *reusable* way, and allow for visual verifications on one page.

No dependencies, with the only exception of our beloved normalize.css and some really basic css creepy behavior prevention.
Note : Didn't git ignore normalize.css so you can use this HTML boilerplate without the mandatory need of any command line ; and still be able to update it easily.
Note : Added basic google web fonts to prevent untimely eye bleedings.
